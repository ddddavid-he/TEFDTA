# FE-DTA
As a new attention-based model, FEDTA is proposed to predict the binding affinity for bonded and non-bonded drug-target interactions

## Requirements

- Python == 3.7.13
-  pytorch == 1.10.1 + cuda == 11.1
- pandas ==  1.3.5
- numpy == 1.21.5

```

running:
```
    python main.py 
```
If you want to training the model we proposed,


## Online Server

We deployed a pre-trained model on a dedicated server, which is publicly available at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/binding-affinity-prediction
